# NextJS with Tailwind CSS and TypeScript

This is a demo project to show how to setup [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com) and [Jest](https://jestjs.io).

It shows how you can use a utility-first CSS framework with snapshot testing to have nice tests with different component stats (loading, disabled, active, ...).

To reduce the CSS bundle size of TailwindCSS, I added [PurgeCSS](https://www.purgecss.com/).

## Development

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## Testing

`npm test`

## Production

1. `npm run build`
